    "How do we truly measure how resilient they are towards misaligned behaviour?",
    "How do we study their sycophantic tendencies?",
    "If it does reach the right conclusion, how did it do it?",
    "Under what conditions will it mislead us?",
    "If the model is particularly averse even slight amount of risk then how do we know how it performs?",
    "How do we test alignment under distributional shift?",
    "What stress tests reveal alignment failures?"
